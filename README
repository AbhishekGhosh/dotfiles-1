Version controlled dotfiles directory.
Perhaps I can get this working cross-platform and as minimalistic as possible.

To install:
    * Make symbolic links to the vim configuration files (vimrc and gvimrc)
    *** For example:
        ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
        ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

TO DO:
Add more dotfile configurations

--Stan
