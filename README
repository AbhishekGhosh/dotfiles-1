Version controlled dotfiles directory.
Perhaps I can get this working cross-platform and as minimalistic as possible.

To install:
Clone this repository from Github:
*** For example:
    git clone https://github.com/Happy-Dude/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

Vim configurations:
    * Make symbolic links to the vim configuration files (vimrc and gvimrc)
    *** For example:
        ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
        ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
    * Make symbolic link to vim directory
    *** For example:
        ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim

Tmux configurations:
    * Make symbolic link to tmux configuration
    *** For example:
        ln -s ~/dotfiles/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

NOTE:
In .zshrc or .bashrc (whenever that will be made), keep emacs bindings... Commands are easier with consistent emacs implementations.
A modal terminal doesn't work too well... (And I like vim!)

TO DO:
Continue learning about tmux
Learn zsh -- and oh-my-zsh?
Make installation script -- its easier that way :)
Learn xmonad
Learn markdown for documentation (like for this readme)
Add more dotfile configurations
